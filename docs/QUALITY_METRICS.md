# Quality Metrics & Reporting

This document outlines the comprehensive quality metrics and reporting system implemented for the Stock Dashboard v2 application, ensuring >80% test coverage, <2s loading time, <100ms interactions, and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

## Overview

The quality metrics system provides automated monitoring and reporting across four key areas:
1. **Test Coverage** - Code coverage analysis and reporting
2. **Performance Benchmarks** - Load time and interaction performance monitoring
3. **Accessibility Compliance** - WCAG 2.1 AA standard validation
4. **Error Monitoring** - Error boundary testing and error tracking

## Quality Targets

### Primary Benchmarks
- **Test Coverage**: >80% statements, branches, functions, and lines
- **Load Time**: <2 seconds for initial page load
- **Interaction Time**: <100ms for UI responses
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Error Rate**: <5% error rate in production

### Quality Gates
All benchmarks must pass for deployment approval:
- ✅ Test coverage meets minimum thresholds
- ✅ Performance benchmarks achieved
- ✅ No critical accessibility violations
- ✅ Error boundaries function correctly
- ✅ Overall quality score >80/100

## Implementation

### 1. Test Coverage Monitoring

#### Configuration
```typescript
// vitest.coverage.config.ts
coverage: {
  provider: 'v8',
  reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html', 'lcov'],
  thresholds: {
    global: {
      statements: 80,
      branches: 75,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80
    },
    // Critical components require higher coverage
    'src/services/**': { statements: 90, branches: 85 },
    'src/stores/**': { statements: 85, branches: 80 },
    'src/utils/**': { statements: 90, branches: 85 }
  }
}
```

#### Running Coverage Tests
```bash
# Detailed coverage analysis
npm run test:coverage:detailed

# Standard coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# View HTML coverage report
open coverage/index.html
```

### 2. Performance Monitoring

#### Performance Monitor Utility
```typescript
import { performanceMonitor } from './utils/performanceMonitor'

// Record page load performance
performanceMonitor.recordPageLoad('dashboard')

// Time function execution
const result = await performanceMonitor.timeFunction(
  'fetchStocks',
  () => stockService.fetchStocks()
)

// Record user interactions
performanceMonitor.recordInteraction('button_click', 85)

// Generate performance report
const report = performanceMonitor.generateReport()
```

#### Performance Benchmarks
- **Page Load Time**: Measured from navigation start to load complete
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS monitoring
- **Interaction Response**: UI feedback timing
- **Memory Usage**: Memory leak detection during extended use

### 3. Accessibility Testing

#### Automated WCAG 2.1 AA Testing
```typescript
import { accessibilityTester } from './utils/accessibilityTester'

// Test DOM element for accessibility
const report = await accessibilityTester.testElement(document.body)

// React hook for component testing
const { testElement } = useAccessibilityTester()
```

#### Accessibility Features Tested
- **Color Contrast**: 4.5:1 ratio for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic markup
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Form Accessibility**: Labels and error messages
- **Heading Structure**: Proper H1-H6 hierarchy

#### Playwright Accessibility Tests
```javascript
// e2e/quality-metrics.spec.ts
import { injectAxe, checkA11y } from 'axe-playwright'

await injectAxe(page)
const violations = await getViolations(page)
expect(violations.filter(v => v.impact === 'critical')).toHaveLength(0)
```

### 4. Error Monitoring & Boundary Testing

#### Error Monitor Setup
```typescript
import { errorMonitor, ErrorBoundaryWithMonitoring } from './utils/errorMonitor'

// Initialize error monitoring
errorMonitor.initialize()

// Record custom errors
errorMonitor.recordError({
  message: 'API call failed',
  severity: 'high',
  type: 'network'
})

// Enhanced Error Boundary
<ErrorBoundaryWithMonitoring fallback={ErrorFallback}>
  <App />
</ErrorBoundaryWithMonitoring>
```

#### Error Types Monitored
- **JavaScript Errors**: Uncaught exceptions and runtime errors
- **Network Errors**: API failures and connectivity issues
- **React Errors**: Component crashes and boundary failures
- **Promise Rejections**: Unhandled async errors
- **User Errors**: Form validation and input errors

### 5. Comprehensive Quality Reporting

#### Quality Metrics Dashboard
```typescript
import { qualityMetrics } from './utils/qualityMetrics'

// Generate comprehensive report
const report = await qualityMetrics.generateReport()

// Check quality gates
const { passed, failures } = await qualityMetrics.checkQualityGates()

// Export for CI/CD
const ciData = await qualityMetrics.exportForCI()
```

#### Report Generation
```bash
# Generate quality report
node scripts/quality-report.js

# Run all quality checks
npm run test:quality-gates

# View quality dashboard
open reports/quality-report.html
```

## Quality Report Structure

### Summary Metrics
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "overallScore": 85,
    "status": "good",
    "testCoverage": 87,
    "performanceScore": 82,
    "accessibilityScore": 88,
    "errorRate": 0.02
  }
}
```

### Benchmark Results
```json
{
  "benchmarks": {
    "loadTime": {
      "target": 2000,
      "actual": 1850,
      "status": "pass"
    },
    "testCoverage": {
      "target": 80,
      "actual": 87,
      "status": "pass"
    },
    "accessibility": {
      "target": "AA",
      "actual": "AA",
      "status": "pass"
    }
  }
}
```

### Recommendations
The system provides actionable recommendations based on current metrics:
- Specific areas for coverage improvement
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Accessibility compliance guidance
- Error reduction strategies

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
- name: Run unit tests with coverage
  run: npm run test:coverage:detailed

- name: Run quality metrics tests
  run: npm run test:quality

- name: Generate quality report
  run: node scripts/quality-report.js

- name: Check quality gates
  run: npm run test:quality-gates
```

### Quality Gates Enforcement
The CI/CD pipeline enforces quality gates:
1. **Coverage Threshold**: Fails if coverage drops below 80%
2. **Performance Regression**: Fails if load time exceeds 2 seconds
3. **Accessibility Violations**: Fails on critical or serious violations
4. **Error Rate**: Fails if error rate exceeds 5%

### Artifact Retention
- **Coverage Reports**: HTML and JSON formats
- **Performance Reports**: Timing and Core Web Vitals data
- **Accessibility Reports**: WCAG violation details
- **Quality Dashboard**: Comprehensive HTML report
